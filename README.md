# Synchronous FIFO

This project involves designing, implementing, and simulating a synchronous FIFO buffer using Verilog HDL. The FIFO buffer will handle data storage and retrieval in a sequential manner, with synchronous read and write operations controlled by a single clock signal.

## Replication on EDA Playground

1. Visit EDA Playground:
    ```sh
    https://www.edaplayground.com/x/RhC2
    ```
2. Select the Simulator (Use Industry Standard Simulator for Correct Functioning)
3. Check Open EPWave before running
4. Save and Run the project:

## Features
- **Configurable Depth and Width**: The depth (number of storage locations) and width (bit-width of each data item) of the FIFO can be configured.
- **Synchronous Operation**: Both read and write operations are synchronized to the same clock signal.
- **Testbench Included**: A testbench is included which writes values into the buffer and starts reading after some delay.
